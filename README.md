# WhatsApp Footy

Minimal web app for a weekly 7-a-side WhatsApp group. No user accounts. Players join a gameweek by picking their name from a dropdown. Organiser actions are protected by a PIN prompt and enforced server-side.

## Setup

1) Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

2) Create a Supabase project and open the SQL editor

Paste the contents of `supabase/schema.sql` to create tables, constraints, and indexes.

3) Insert your players

Example:
```sql
insert into players (first_name, last_name)
values
  ('Sam', 'Nguyen'),
  ('Alex', 'Smith'),
  ('Jamie', 'Lee');
```

4) Add environment variables

Create `.env.local` with:
```
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=your-service-role-key
ORGANISER_PIN=your-pin
```

## Run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## Deploy

1) Deploy the Next.js app to your host (Vercel, Netlify, Render, etc.)
2) Add the same environment variables in your host’s settings:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`
   - `ORGANISER_PIN`
3) Build and start:
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Notes

- Only one open gameweek is allowed at a time (enforced by DB index).
- Organiser writes always go through server route handlers with PIN validation.
- The Supabase service role key never touches the client.
